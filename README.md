Demo of semantic versioning and commit lint.

- **CommitLint**: commit linting tool that will force us to write beautiful commits
- **Husky**: use the commit-msg hook, which will run every time we try to add a commit message
- **Semantic Release**: fully automated version management and package publishing (executed in CI env)
